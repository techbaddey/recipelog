     <p class="title"> Waterleaf Soup </p>
     <dl> 2 cups picked waterleaf</dl>
     <dl> ½ to 1 cooking-spoon ground pepper</dl>
     <dl> 1 cooking-spoon ground onion </dl>
     <dl> ⅓ cooking-spoon (or as desired) ground locust beans </dl>
     <dl> 2 cooking spoons (or less if desired) ground melonseed </dl>
     <dl> ½ cup oil </dl>
     <dl> Salt to taste </dl>
     <dl> Meat as can be afforded </dl>
    
     <p class="sub-title"> Method: </p>
     <ol>
       <li> Prepare meat and cut into pieces. </li>
       <li> Boil and fry. </li>
       <li> Add the prepared ingredients (locust beans included but not melonseed) to the oil in the saucepan in which the meat has been fried. </li>
       <li> Cook this gently, adding water as necessary to turn it into a sort of palm oil soup, then add melonseed, to turn it into melonseed soup; season well. </li>
       <li> Whilst the meat is cooking, prepare the waterleaf, by first picking the leaves off the fruits and stems, and rubbing them to remove the slime and to break the leaves into smaller pieces. </li>
       <li> Wash the leaves well and drain in a basket or colander. </li>
       <li> Add to the palm oil soup. </li>
       <li> Simmer gently until cooked. </li>
       <li> The finished soup must be of an attractive mixture of green, white and red; green (leaves), white (melonseed), red (palm oil). There should not be bits or whole melonseed in the soup, neither should it be watery, because the waterleaf gives out some natural water. </li>
     </ol>

   <section id="contenttwo">
     <p class="title"> Spinach Soup </p>
     <p> Spinach, also known as Greens </p>
     <dl> 2 cups prepared spinach well pressed in </dl>
     <dl> ½ to 1 cooking-spoon ground pepper (or to taste) </dl>
     <dl> 1 cooking-spoon ground tomatoes</dl> 
     <dl> 1 cooking-spoon ground onion</dl>
     <dl> ½ cooking-spoon ground crayfish </dl>
     <dl> Ground locust bean (optional) </dl>
     <dl> Fish or meat as desired </dl>
     <dl> About ½ cup of palm oil and salt to taste</dl>

     <p class="sub-title"> Method: </p> 
     <ol>
       <li> Put a small quantity of water to boil, meanwhile pick and wash the greens. </li>
       <li> Boil the greens in the boiling water until soft, but not too soft. </li>
       <li> Remove, put in a colander or basket. ,</li>
       <li> Run cold water over it, or just wash in a basin of cold water. (Do not overdo this) </li>
       <li> Shred or cut up the cooked greens. </li>
       <li> Add the prepared greens to the rich palm oil stew made with the ingredients listed above. Turn well so that the stew is well mixed with the greens. </li>
       <li> Leave to cook for a short time to reheat (but not recook) the greens, and bind all the ingredients. </li>
     </ol>
     <p style="font-style: italic;"> Note: melonseed may be added if liked and instead of grinding all the ingredients in the stew, one-third of them may be sliced or chopped and added to it.</p>
