     <p class="title">Boiling </p>
     <p> This is cooking in boiling water or stock. The temperature of the water should be 82Â°c  or a little below. The food is covered and is in direct contact with the boiling liquid. boiling is done to either extract nutriment from the food or to preserve it. If the former, the food is put in cold water and is gently heated to boil. If the latter, the food is put in boiling water: hence meat for beef tea is first put in cold water, and that for meat stew is cooked in boiling water. 
         All starchy foods have to be boiled to cook them thoroughly and render them digestible--simmering, that is, cooking below boiling point is not satisfactory. </p>
     <p class="sub-title"> Advantages of Boiling </p>
     <ol>
       <li> Boiling is a quick method of cooking. </li>
       <li> It does not need constant attention, and </li>
       <li> It is cheaper, safer and easier than frying or steaming. </li>
     </0l>
     <p class="sub-title"> Disadvantages of Boiling </p>
     <ol>
       <li> Some valuable mineral salts and juice and flavour are lost especially in the case of vegetables where mineral salts dissolve in the water which is usually thrown away. (If possible save the stock and use in cooking) </li>
       <li>Vitamin C is destroyed to a certain extent </li>
     </ol>

     <p class="title"> Frying </p>
     <p>Frying is cooking in hot oil. The oils used in frying in this country are vegetable oils, but oils from the livers of white fish, the flesh of oily fish and the tissues of animals can also be used. Cod and halibut liver oils are examples of fish liver oils and herring and mackerel oils are oils from oily fishes. 
        Butter, though a good fat for food, is about the least satisfactory for frying. It burns quickly, and the best oil for frying is that which can be raised to a high temperature without burning. As most vegetable oils can stand up to the temperature required for long frying they are more suitable for frying than animal fat. Olive oil is an excellent oil for frying. Palm oil, coconut oil, groundnut oil, and melonseed oil are the vegetable oils commonly used for frying. Of these palm oil is the most widely used and is fortunately the most nutritious. It is extracted from palm nuts. 
        Pure groundnut oil is a much better oil for frying, it is extracted from groundnuts and has less food value than palm oil. It gives foods fried in it a very attractive pleasing colour. Coconut oil and melonseed oils are oils extracted from coconut flesh and melonseed respectively using different local methods or by machine extraction. </p>
      
     <p class="sub-title"> Types of Frying </p>
     <p style="font-style: italic;">There are three ways of frying: </p>
     <ol>
       <li> Drying frying. Suitable for oily foods like herring and mackerel. Very little fat is used, so little that only the bottom of the frying pan is oiled, to prevent the food from burning. At times, the food gives out enough of its own oil for frying, e.g. fatty pork, bacon, and so on. </li>
       <li> Shallow fat frying. The oil covers the bottom of the pan in which case the common frying pan is used. It is suitable for frying meat, white fish, plantain, some omelets, chinchin, yam balls and so on. </li>
       <li> Deep fat frying. A deep saucepan is used and at least half or often over half of the saucepan is filled with fat. Foods that are meant to rise or be round are best fried by this method. <br>
            For easy frying a deep fat saucepan with a frying basket is useful. The food, for example, chinchin, slices of yam, can be put in the basket, dipped in the oil at the same time and removed together. This ensures even browning. </li>
     </ol>
     <p class="sub-title"> Advantages of frying </p>
     <ol>
       <li> It is a quick method of cooking because of the high temperature to which frying oil can be raised without burning. </li>
       <li> The flavour of fried foods is retained, and they look attractive and appetising. </li>
     </ol>
     <p class="sub-title"> Disadvantages of frying </p>
     <ol>
       <li> Being a quick method of cooking, it is not suitable for tough cuts of meat. </li>
       <li> Frying requires continuous and constant attention. It is not as easy as boiling. </li>
       <li>Fried foods are not as easily digested as boiled or steamed foods. </li>
     </ol>
     <p class="sub-title"> Useful Hints for good results </p>
     <ol>
       <li>Use clean oil and strain each time after use. This helps to preserve the oil from getting spoilt quickly. </li> 
       <li> The oil should be hot and of the correct degree of heat for the kind of food being cooked, otherwise the result will be poor. The oil penetrates into the food instead of frying it quickly, making the food greasy and unattractive. </li> 
       <li> Fry only a few pieces at a time; too many pieces cool down the oil. </li>
       <li> Dry the food before frying to avoid mixing cold water with hot oil. This is practicable in the case of yam, plantain and so on.</li> 
       <li> Avoid turning the food frequently as this spoils the result. Fry one side until it is cooked and brown before turning to the other side. </li>
       <li> Drain carefully first over the frying pan, then in a crushed paper. When frying in quantity it is better to use a basket. Leave the fried food in the basket placed over a basin to catch the oil. </li>
       <li> Coated food must be carefully coated and the breadcrumbs will pressed on the food, to prevent loose crumbs falling into the oil. </li>
       <li> Reheat the oil, and get it back to the correct degree of heat before frying the second quantity. </li>
       <li> Do not cover fried food whilst still hot. The steam will condense on the food and make it soft and soggy. </li>
     </ol>
     <br>
     <p style="font-style: italic;"> Note: A piece of onion removes the raw smell in oil especially in groundnut oil. The oil is hot and ready for frying many kinds of food when it gives off smoke. This is often called smoking oil. </p>

     <p class="title"> Baking </p>
     <p> Baking is a method of cooking by dry heat in an enclosed space called an oven. What happens in that enclosed air is heated and it is the hot air that cooks the food. Thus baking is cooking in hot air. 
         Those who have ovens at home may like to do their own baking. The following are some baking rules: </p>
     <ol>
       <li> Study your oven well: in many cases you will find that the hotter part of the oven is the top. </li>
       <li> Do not waste oven space: plan your work so that you do a lot of baking one day so that the oven is filled to capacity. This does not however mean that the oven should be so crowded that there is hardly any space for the hot air to circulate. </li>
       <li> Once the food is in the oven, do not open it often, for this reduces its temperature. </li>
       <li> Bake together dishes that will take about the same length of time in order to avoid frequent opening of the oven. </li>
       <li> Do not bake meat and biscuits or cake together as the meat is apt to impart its flavour to the cake. </li>
       <li> If the oven is too hot, put a pan of cold water in to reduce the temperature and get some hot water, or open it for a short time.</li> 
       <li> Place your oven away from the door, to prevent inrush of air or draught from the door into the oven when the latter is opened. </li>
     </ol>
     <p class="sub-title"> Baked foods</p>
     <p> Bread, cakes, biscuits, root vegetables, e.g. potatoes, yam, plantain, can all be baked in the oven, so can fish or meat and many varieties of pudding. </p>
