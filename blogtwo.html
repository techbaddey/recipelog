     <p class="title"> Cooking root veggies </p>
     <p>Of all the root vegetables commonly taken in Nigeria, yam takes the first place nutritionally. People who have no knowledge of the science of nutrition give it a better place of honour than either cassava or cocoyam. The main food value of root vegetables is carbohydrate. 
         Besides carbohydrates, root vegetables contain water-soluble Vitamin C and some mineral materials. Most of these are not lost through bad choice, preparation and cooking. The following are guiding hints towards achieving this aim. 
         Choose firm fresh vegetables and new ones. </p>
     <p>Do not peel or soak in water for a long time before cooking as the food value is reduced considerably. If this cannot be helped, then soak in cold salted water instead in ordinary water. The salt water dissolves less of the valuable food constituents and at the same time seasons the food. 
        Avoid cutting into very small pieces. At times this cannot be avoided as the preparation may demand grating or cutting the roots finely, but when they can be served in large pieces always do so. 
        Boil vegetables in very little boiling salted water should just be enough to prevent the saucepan from burning. Cover whilst cooking in order to keep in the steam. 
        Avoid overcooking root vegetables. When boiled boiled they should change colour, and when cooked they should become soft and swollen; but they should no be broken or mushy. 
        Serve after cooking as soon as possible. Reheating or warning for a long time destroys more vitamin C. </p>
     <p class="sub-title"> Cooking by frying </p>
     <p>If the vegetables are new fry in hot oil at once. If they are old first parboil and then fry. If yam, cook in oil to which water is added; the yam is parboiling whilst the water is being driven off the oil, and it finishes cooking by frying. If they are to be baked, they are best baked with the skins on. </p>

     <p class="title"> Examples</p>
     <p class="sub-title"> Yam </p>
     <ol>
       <li> White yam </li>
       <li> Water yam, so called because of its watery composition. Wateryam is different from white yam in that it has three coverings. The outer cover is the skin to which the prickles adhere. Underneath it is a coloured sort of reddish membrane, and the third covering is next to the flesh of the yam. If the flesh of the yam is cut across, droplets of water usually appear on its surface, hence the name. </li>
       <li> Cocoyam, it takes a longer time to cook than yam, it can be used and prepared in nearly all the ways white yam is used, except that it does not make good flour. </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="sub-title"> Cassava </p>
      <p style="font-style: italic;"> Garri </p>
      <p>Garri is the most popular of cassava products. There is no part of Nigeria and the Cameroons where it is not eaten. As staple foods both cassava and garri are not satisfactory from the nutritional point of view, since they are deficient in protein and Vitamin B. <br>
         Boiled cassava is sliced into wafers and is often eaten with coconut in some parts of the country. As a thirst quencher taken occasionally it will do no harm, but it should not be relied upon as a meal. </p>
