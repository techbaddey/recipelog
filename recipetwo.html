     <dl> 1 big onion </dl>
     <dl> 1 or 2 dessert-spoons ground pepper </dl>
     <dl> Tomato if liked </dl>
     <dl> ⅓ bottle palm oil </dl>
     <dl> ½ cup crayfish or more as desired</dl>
     <p> or </p>
     <dl> 454g yam </dl>
     <dl> 1½ cups of water </dl>
     <dl> 1 big pepper </dl>
     <dl> ¼ onion</dl>
     <dl> 1 cooking-spoon of palm oil</dl>
    
     <p class="sub-title"> First Method: </p>
     <ol>
       <li> Prepare meat and boil in a little quantity of water until tender. </li>
       <li> Remove from the water and fry. </li>
       <li> Add more water to the meat stock water and boil. </li>
       <li> Meanwhile, peel and wash and cut the yam into pieces of desirable sizes, but the yam pieces must be of even size. </li>
       <li> Add the yam to the boiling meat stock. Add oil and cook nearly ready. </li>
       <li> Add the fried pieces of meat, ground pepper, onions and other ingredients and stir well. </li>
       <li> Cook gently for about 10 - 15 minutes or until the ingredients are well cooked and have had chance to simmer into the yam. </li>
       <li> Stir well but gently; taste for salt. If extra is needed, dissolve in very little hot water and add to the yam mixture. </li>
     </ol>
     <p class="sub-title"> Second Method: </p>
     <ol>
       <li> Boil the meat, add the oil and fry. </li>
       <li> Put ground ingredients in water and boil. Add oil. </li>
       <li> Add the prepared yam and cook in the meat stew taking great care not to let it burn. </li>
       <li> Serve when the yam is cooked and has absorbed the oil and the ingredients. </li>
     </ol>
     <p style="font-style: italic;"> Variation: Vegetable Pottage: To add to the food value of yam pottage and for variety, soft edible green shredded vegetable may be cooked with it. This may be added 5 to 10 minutes before the pottage is ready. </p>

    <section id="contenttwo">
     <p class="title"> Pounded Yam </p>
     <p class="sub-title"> Method: </p>
     <ol>
       <li> Boil yam without salt, put in a warm place. </li>
       <li> Whilst still hot, put it in a mortar, and pound a few pieces at a time, adding more yam from the pot and pounding quickly and firmly until all the yam is added, or as much as can be comfortably managed. Continue pounding until yam binds together into a solid mass. </li>
       <li> Mould into a ball, smoothing the sides by working it round the sides of the mortar. </li>
     </ol>
     <p style="font-style: italic;"> Note: During the pounding it is often necessary to add water to soften it and help to bind it, so save the water in which yam was boiled, or use boiling water. Add the water gradually and cautiously. If too much is added, it becomes soft and drawy losing its right texture. </p>
