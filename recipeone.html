     <p class="title"> Jollof Rice </p>
     <p> There are many ways of preparing Jollof rice of which two are discussed here. </p>
     <dl> 1 cup of rice </dl>
     <dl> ½ onion </dl>
     <dl> 4 large peppers</dl>
     <dl> Small peppers to taste </dl>
     <dl> ½ tin tomato puree</dl>
     <dl> 2 spoons ground crayfish</dl>
     <dl> 1 cooking spoon groundnut oil </dl>
     <dl> Cabbage or patminger or thyme for flavouring </dl>
     <dl> Pieces of meat as desired </dl>
    
     <p style="font-style: italic;"> Preparation: Wash rice until clean. Grind three-quarters of the tomatoes, pepper, and onions and slice the remainder. Grind all the crayfish. Wash and cut the meat into pieces of desired sizes. Boil the meat in salted water after frying in hot groundnut oil. Save the meat stock. </p>
    
     <p class="sub-title"> First Method: </p>
     <ol>
       <li> Cook the rice in boiling salted water. Average Nigerian rice increases in bulk 3 - 4 times when cooked and can absorb 3 times its volume of water, so cook the above quantity in 3 cups of water, and add more boiling water if necessary. </li>
       <li> Rewash the rice after it had been cooked for about 10 minutes. This is done to remove any surplus starch and prevent the rice from sticking. </li>
       <li> Cook the rice now in the saved meat stock until it is nearly but not completely cooked. Then add the ground ingredients, groundnut oil and the meat. Add crayfish last. Stir carefully and leave to simmer, i.e. to cook gently until the ingredients are well cooked and bound with the rice. </li>
       <li> Add tomato puree </li>
       <li> To add flavour, patminger, cabbage or any edible green vegetable may be added. These vegetables should be shredded and cooked with the rice. Thyme, a popular flavouring for jollof rice, or white pepper may also be added. </li>
     </ol>
    <p class="sub-title"> Second Method: </p>
     <ol>
       <li> Instead of cooking the rice and adding the raw ingredients, the rice and the rich stew may be cooked separately, and the stew is then added to the nearly cooked rice and the rice finishes cooking in the stew. To make a rich tomato stew, you need pepper, tomatoes, onions, crayfish in more or less equal quantity, and groundnut oil.</li>
       <li> Wash and boil the pieces of meat. </li>
       <li> Heat the oil and fry the meat in it. </li>
       <li> Add the ground ingredients to the oil and meat and cook gently until there is a definite change in colour and the raw smell of ingredient changes to the well-known delicious smell. </li>
       <li> Reduce the heat, and add to the stew small quantity of water or stock left from the meat. </li>
       <li> Cook until the water dries again and add the tomato puree. This is essential to give the rice the characteristics tomato colour. </li>
     </ol>

   <section id="contenttwo">
      <p class="title"> Coconut Rice</p>
       <dl> 1 coconut </dl>
       <dl> 1 cup of rice</dl> 
       <dl> 3 or 4 small tomatoes</dl> 
       <dl> Pepper as desired </dl>
       <dl> ¼ onion </dl>
       <dl> Crayfish as desired </dl>
       <dl> Salt </dl>
      
      <p class="sub-title"> Method:</p>
      <ol>
       <li> Wash rice and boil for a few minutes. While the rice is boiling break the coconut, grate and add enough water to the grated coconut, squeeze out the milk. Strain. </li>
       <li> Wash the rice the second time. Put the pot of coconut milk on the fire, and add the pieces of meat or dry fish. </li>
       <li> When it boils, add the rice and when the rice is cooked, add the rest of the ingredients and seasonings. </li>
       <li>Cook until the water is dry and the rice absorbs the coconut milk and ingredients well. </li>
      </ol>
      <p style="font-style: italic;">Note: This is just rice cooked in coconut milk and is similar to jollof rice, except that oil is added to coconut rice. If good coconut is used, it gives out its own oil, and the finished dish looks dry but it should be tasted before it is criticized. Traditionally no oil if available or groundnut oil may be added according to taste.</p>
