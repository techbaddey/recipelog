     <p class="title"> About fruits </p>
     <p> Most fruits contain Vitamin A and C principally. Vitamin A, which is essential for growth and the proper functioning of the eyes, is more abundant in the red and yellow fruits. Vitamin C helps to maintain the general health of the body by helping the body to build considerable resistance against infection. Its deficiency results in a general feeling of poor health and liability to infection.</p> 
     <p> Besides these vitamins, fruits contain starch and sugar in sugar varying amounts depending on the ripeness of the fruits. The sugar in ripe fruit is one of the simplest of sugars and is easy to digest and therefore suitable for children. Unripe fruits contain starch which changes gradually to sugar as fruits ripen; hence some unripe fruits need to be cooked whilst ripe ones need not to be cooked. For instance, green plantain, green pawpaw and green guava need to be cooked while if ripe, they do not need to be cooked. The mineral matters that fruits can purify the blood and strengthen the bones and teeth generally. The cellulose from the skins of ripe fruits, if eaten, prevents constipation. Since fruits, besides being refreshing and thirst-quenching, are rich in food value, their importance cannot then be overstressed. </p>
     <p> Fruit acid in unripe fruit is as irritable to the digestive system as is is unwelcome to our palate. That is why when we eat some fruit like unripe mango or guava with the green skins on, they irritate the system and we get sick. </p>
     <p> As much ripe fruit as can be eaten raw should be eaten so, for the body gets more vitamins from raw fruit. If, however, the fruit is of harder variety with seeds that many people find difficult to digest, e.g. guava, it should be cooked. </p>

    <section id="contenttwo">
     <p class="title"> Examples </p>
     <p class="sub-title"> Mangoes </p>
     <p> There are two common types of mangoes in the country; the juicy variety and the fleshy. The juicy mango is just sucked. The fleshy mango often referred to as cherry mango perhaps because of its colour when ripe, is not as common as the former. </p> 
     <p class="sub-title"> Guava </p>
     <p> Because of the seeds in guava many people find it indigestible eaten raw. Those people need not to give up eating guava, they only need to take it in a different form, i.e. in cooked dishes; or still raw but sieved free from the seeds. </p>
     <p class="sub-title"> Limes </p>
     <p> Though lime is used a lot in the kitchen, this is not a particularly desirable fruit to eat. It is too acid and sharp to the taste, and takes so much sugar to sweeten it when made into drink. </p>
     <p> Some people, however, like lime juice and limeade as a change from orange and other sweet fruit drinks, and may like to make it at home. </p>
     <p class="sub-title"> Cashew </p>
     <p> The only way of serving the fruit is by washing and serving it whole or sliced. It is usually just sucked, and the nuts roasted and eaten. The roasted nuts are very delicious and can be used to thicken soup in place of groundnuts. Instead of ground almonds for coating rich cakes before icing them, ground cashew nuts have been substituted with equal success. </p>
     <p style="font-style: italic;"> Note: Those who suck cashew should remember that the juice stain is very difficult to remove and so should suck with great care. It is safer to prepare the fruit in slices and eat with fork. </p>
     <p class="sub-title"> Grapefruit</p>
     <p> This is another variety of citrus fruit. It is usually sweeter than lime but not as sweet as ripe orange. Like other fruits it contains Vitamin C, sugar and mineral salts, but it is sharp to the taste and has to have additional sugar to make it sweet enough for most people. </p>
     <p> It is usually served as fruit for breakfast, well prepared, ready to be eaten with a teaspoon </p>
